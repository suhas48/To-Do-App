# To-Do List App

This repository contains code for creating a simple To-Do List application using Python and Streamlit. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and clearing the task list. The tasks are stored in a CSV file for persistence.

## Usage

To use the To-Do List application, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd to-do-list
   ```

4. Run the application using Streamlit:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

5. A web app will open in your browser, displaying the To-Do List interface.

6. To add a new task, type the task description in the "Add a new task" input box and click the "Add" button.

7. To mark a task as completed, click the checkbox next to the task.

8. To clear all tasks, click the "Clear all tasks" button.

## Repository Files

- `main.py`: This file contains the main code for the To-Do List application. It uses the Streamlit library for building the user interface and handles task management functions.

- `tasks.csv`: This CSV file is used to store the tasks. Each task is stored as a separate row in the file.

## Streamlit Web App
